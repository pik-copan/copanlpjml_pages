features:
  - positions:
      - name: Flexible, component-based model coupling
        content: "Exchange any data between models in any language.
                  Component-based coupling warrants high modularity and code-driven introspection of coupling setups."
  - positions:
      - name: Lighweight Python framework
        content: "Use the power and convenience of Python to wrap you models, write adapters, and set up model linkage."
  - positions:
      - name: Minimal, unified component interface
        content: "Wrapping existing models is easy! Write python bindings for initialization and step functionality, and implement the straight-forward FINAM interface."
  - positions:
      - name: Bi-directional and circular coupling
        content: "FINAM's scheduling algorithm allows for bi-directional and circular coupling setups."
  - positions:
      - name: Model coupling at initialization
        content: "Due to FINAM's unique iterative initialization approach, models can depend on inputs from other models already during initialization."
