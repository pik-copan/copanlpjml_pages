## What are Social-Ecological Systems?

Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex, integrated systems in which humans are part of nature. These systems emphasize that people, communities, economies, societies, and cultures are embedded in the biosphere and shape it, from local to global scales.

## Key Characteristics

- **Interconnected**: Human and natural systems are deeply intertwined, with changes in one affecting the other
- **Complex**: Multiple interactions and feedbacks create emergent behaviors
- **Dynamic**: Systems change over time, often in non-linear and unexpected ways
- **Multi-scale**: Processes occur and interact across different spatial and temporal scales
- **Adaptive**: Systems can reorganize and evolve in response to change

## Why Study SES?

Understanding social-ecological systems is crucial for addressing global challenges:

1. **Climate Change**
   - How societies adapt to and mitigate climate impacts
   - Feedback between human activities and climate systems

2. **Food Security**
   - Agricultural practices and ecosystem services
   - Food production and distribution networks
   - Social and economic factors affecting food access

3. **Biodiversity**
   - Human impacts on species and habitats
   - Conservation strategies and community involvement
   - Nature's contributions to people

4. **Resource Management**
   - Sustainable use of natural resources
   - Community-based management systems
   - Traditional ecological knowledge

## Modeling SES with copan:LPJmL

copan:LPJmL provides a powerful framework for studying social-ecological systems by:

- Integrating human decision-making with biophysical processes
- Simulating land-use changes and their impacts
- Exploring feedback between social and ecological components
- Testing management strategies and policy interventions
- Analyzing system resilience and tipping points

## Applications

- **Regenerative Agriculture**: Study how farming practices affect both ecosystem health and human well-being
- **Climate Adaptation**: Explore how communities can adapt to changing environmental conditions
- **Food Systems**: Analyze the sustainability and resilience of food production systems
- **Ecosystem Services**: Assess how natural systems support human societies and economies
