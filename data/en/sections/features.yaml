  - positions:
      - name: Flexible, component-based model coupling
        content_left: |
          Exchange any data between models in any language.
          Component-based coupling warrants high modularity and code-driven introspection of coupling setups.

          [IMAGE COUPLING]
  - positions:
      - name: Lighweight Python framework
        content_left: |
          Use the power and convenience of Python to wrap you models, write adapters, and set up model linkage.
        content_right: |
          ```python
          def x():
              pass
          ```
  - positions:
      - name: Minimal, unified component interface
        content_left: |
          Wrapping existing models is easy! Write python bindings for initialization and step functionality,
          and implement the straight-forward FINAM interface.

          [PYTHON CODE BLOCK]
  - positions:
      - name: Bi-directional and circular coupling
        content_left: |
          FINAM's scheduling algorithm allows for bi-directional and circular coupling setups.
        content_right: |
          [IMAGE BI-DIR COUPLING]
  - positions:
      - name: Model coupling at initialization
        content_left: |
          Due to FINAM's unique iterative initialization approach,
          models can depend on inputs from other models already during initialization.
