## What is World-Earth Modeling (WEM)?

**World-Earth Models (WEMs) connect human decisions with Earth system feedbacks.** Unlike traditional Earth System Models (ESMs), they model society and nature as **co-evolving** systems rather than treating humans as external drivers.

**The key difference:** Traditional ESMs use fixed scenarios for human behavior, while WEMs simulate how human decisions actually change in response to environmental feedback - and how those changes then affect the environment again.

## How WEMs Work

**Unlike ESMs, WEMs feature:**
- **🔄 Bidirectional coupling**: Human decisions affect the environment, environmental changes influence human decisions
- **👥 Dynamic human agency**: People adapt their behavior based on what they observe and learn
- **📊 Closed feedback loops**: Environmental changes immediately influence future human behavior
- **🌍 Global scale**: Simulates these dynamics across the entire planet simultaneously

**This creates coevolutionary dynamics** where human societies and Earth system processes shape each other over time - something impossible with traditional modeling approaches.

## The copan:LPJmL Framework

**copan:LPJmL is the first practical framework for building WEMs** by combining detailed land system modeling (LPJmL) with flexible social modeling (copan:CORE).

**Technical innovations that enable WEM development:**
- **🔗 Annual coupling**: LPJmL and social processes exchange data every simulation year
- **📊 Three taxon structure**: ENV (biophysical), MET (socio-metabolic), CUL (socio-cultural) processes
- **🌍 Global grid integration**: Social agents operate on the same 0.5° × 0.5° grid as LPJmL (67,420 cells)
- **⚡ Modular design**: Supports agent-based, rule-based, optimization, and AI-enhanced approaches

**See our [examples](/examples/) for three working WEM implementations** that demonstrate these capabilities in practice.
