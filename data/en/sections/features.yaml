          Use the power and convenience of Python to wrap you models, write adapters, and set up model linkage.

          Benefit from Python as glue code to couple models from different programming languages.
          Exchange any data between models in any language!

          ```python
          (
              cpp_model.outputs["precip"]
              >> TimeIntegration()
              >> fortran_model.inputs["precip"]
          )
          ```

      - name: Flexible, component-based model coupling
        content_left: |
          Component-based coupling warrants high modularity and easy code-driven introspection of coupling setups.

  - positions:
      - name: Minimal, unified component interface
        content_left: |
          Wrapping existing models is easy! Write Python bindings for initialization and step functionality,
          and implement the straight-forward FINAM interface.
        content_right: |
          ```python
          class MyComponent(ATimeComponent):
              def __init__(self, ...)
              def initialize(self)
              def connect(self)
              def validate(self)
              def update(self)
              def finalize(self)
          ```
  - positions:
      - name: Minimal-effort adapters
        content_left: |
          Adapters are used for data transformations between components.
          Examples are regridding, unit conversions or temporal interpolation.
          FINAM's adapter interface is simple and easy to implement.
        content_right: |
          ```python
          class ScaleAdapter(AAdapter):
              def __init__(self, scale):
                  super().__init__()
                  self.scale = scale
              def _get_data(self, time):
                  d = self.pull_data(time)
                  return d * self.scale
          ```
  - positions:
      - name: Bi-directional and circular coupling
        content_left: |
          FINAM's scheduling algorithm allows for bi-directional and circular coupling setups,
          as well as fully flexible and even varying model time steps.

  - positions:
      - name: Spatio-temporal data types
        content_left: |
          FINAM is primarily designed for linking environmental models for different domains,
          like hydrosphere, pedosphere and biosphere.

          For fast development, FINAM provides built-in support for a variety of spatial and spatio-temporal data types.
          It uses `xarray` for structured and unstructured spatial data, and `pint` for units handling.
