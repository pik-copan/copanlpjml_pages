  - title: "From Farm to Planet: The InSEEDS World-Earth Model for Simulating Transitions to Regenerative Agriculture"

    paper:
      summary: "Industrialised agriculture has contributed to ecological degradation and planetary boundary transgressions, while being increasingly affected by climate change. Sustainable approaches like Regenerative Agriculture offer promising alternatives, but most studies overlook the complex social-ecological dynamics underlying large-scale adoption. To address this gap, we introduce InSEEDS – a novel World-Earth model that couples LPJmL vegetation modeling with agent-based farmer decision-making. Distinguishing between traditionalist and pioneer farmer types, we analyze conservation tillage adoption dynamics and find that social networks and ecological heterogeneity play critical roles in transitions. Conservation tillage yields positive effects on soil carbon and crop yield, though outcomes are context-dependent."

    paper:
      summary: "We present an open-source software framework for developing so-called world–Earth models that link physical, chemical and biological processes with social, economic and cultural processes to study the Earth system's future trajectories in the Anthropocene. Due to its modular structure, the software allows interdisciplinary studies of global change and sustainable development that combine stylized model components from Earth system science, climatology, economics, ecology and sociology."

    paper:
      summary: "In the Anthropocene, the social dynamics of human societies have become critical to understanding planetary-scale Earth system dynamics. The conceptual foundations of Earth system modelling have externalised social processes in ways that now hinder progress in understanding Earth resilience and informing governance of global environmental change. New approaches to global modelling of the human World are needed to address these challenges. We present taxonomies for structuring models for World–Earth systems analysis that enable the systematic development of models capable of simulating complex and entangled human–Earth system processes."
