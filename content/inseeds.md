<h2 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 1rem;">üöÄ A New Generation of Modelling</h2>  

InSEEDS is a next-generation modelling approach for simulating land-based
natural processes in direct interaction with humans and societies described in
[Schwarz et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2025-4079).  
Its focus: **exploring regenerative future pathways for food systems and beyond.**  

Unlike Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), InSEEDS combines:  
‚ú® **Detailed biosphere processes** (e.g. nitrogen fixation, tillage practices)  
ü§ù **Active human or AI agents**, representing real-world decisions and behaviours  

This unique integration opens up new research on **social tipping, resilience, and coevolution between people and ecosystems**.

In contrast to existing modelling approaches, such as Integrated Assessment
Models (IAMs), InSEEDS integrates a process-detailed representation of the
terrestrial biosphere.  
This enables it to simulate specific mechanisms like biological nitrogen
fixation or assess regenerative farming practices that have never before been
explored at a global scale.  

But the true innovation lies not only in process detail ‚Äî it is the inclusion of
humans and societies as active agents.
Building on advances in social science, InSEEDS models human decision-making and
behaviour in unprecedented detail.

## üå± Need for Regenerative Pathways  

The global food system is at a crossroads:  
‚ö†Ô∏è **25%** of GHG emissions stem from agriculture  
‚ö†Ô∏è Land degradation drives biodiversity loss  
‚ö†Ô∏è Feeding 10 billion people by 2050 requires **behavioural changes** ([Gerten et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0465-1))  

üåç Regenerative practices offer a way forward:  
‚úÖ Climate resilience & yield stability ([WEF, 2024](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/regenerative-agriculture-climate-solutions-resilient/))  
‚úÖ Soil as a carbon sink  
‚úÖ Enhanced water retention & biodiversity ([Schreefel et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100404))  

<details>
  <summary>üìñ Read more</summary>

Food systems today contribute roughly one-quarter of global greenhouse gas
emissions, while also driving eutrophication and biodiversity loss.  
At the same time, the transformation of food systems represents a major economic
and ecological opportunity
([WEF, 2024](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/regenerative-agriculture-climate-solutions-resilient/)).  

Regenerative practices not only provide resilience and stability but also deliver multiple benefits: creating carbon sinks by rebuilding soils, increasing water retention, and enhancing biodiversity through nature-based solutions ([Schreefel et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100404)).  
Researching both the potential and realistic pathways for these transformations is critical for success.

üëâ **But how can such a transition play out globally?**  
That‚Äôs what InSEEDS is designed to explore.  

## üîÑ Coevolutionary Modelling  

A global shift to regenerative agriculture involves **complex social-ecological systems**, where human decisions interact with biophysical processes and feedbacks.  

Traditional IAMs cannot capture these dynamics, they ‚Ä¶  
‚ùå Do not capture detailed biogeophysical processes  
‚ùå Do not include endogenous societal interactions  
‚ùå Fail to represent coevolutionary mechanisms  

<details>
  <summary>üìñ Read more</summary>

Right now, we lack a clear understanding of how a global transition to
regenerative agriculture could unfold. Such a transformation involves complex
social-ecological systems, where human decisions interact with biophysical
processes and feedbacks across scales and timeframes
([Donges et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1177/2053019617725537)).  

This interdependence is the foundation of the coevolutionary potential of
regenerative pathways. InSEEDS makes it possible to simulate these pathways and
explore associated dynamics such as social tipping points, long-term benefits
for societies, and climate resilience.

üå± **InSEEDS is the first model able to simulate coevolutionary pathways**,  
capturing feedbacks between societies and ecosystems ‚Äî opening new research on social tipping points and climate resilience.  


## ‚è≥ The Frontier  

The next decade is a **critical window** to scale regenerative agriculture.  
With InSEEDS, we aim to show what pathways are possible, how societies and
ecosystems could coevolve, and what opportunities will emerge.  
This way we want to shape the **scientific and political discourse** on the
future of food.  

<details>
  <summary>üìñ Read more</summary>

Regenerative agriculture could become a paradigm that reshapes the future of food and land management.  
InSEEDS provides a tool to test, compare, and explore pathways toward this future.  
By doing so, we aim to influence both scientific exploration and policy debates on sustainable agriculture and food systems.
