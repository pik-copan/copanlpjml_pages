## What are World-Earth Models?

World-Earth models (WEM) are integrated modeling frameworks that represent the Earth system as a complex, interconnected network of physical, biological, and human components. These models simulate the dynamic interactions between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere to understand global change processes and their consequences.

## Key Characteristics

- **Integrated**: Combines multiple Earth system components in a single modeling framework
- **Global Scale**: Represents processes and interactions across the entire planet
- **Multi-Component**: Incorporates atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and human systems
- **Dynamic**: Simulates time-evolving processes and feedback mechanisms
- **Comprehensive**: Captures the full complexity of Earth system interactions

## Why Study WEM?

World-Earth models are essential for understanding and addressing global challenges:

1. **Climate Change**
   - Project future climate scenarios and impacts
   - Understand carbon cycle dynamics and feedbacks
   - Assess mitigation and adaptation strategies

2. **Biodiversity Loss**
   - Model ecosystem responses to environmental change
   - Predict species distribution shifts
   - Evaluate conservation strategies

3. **Land Use Change**
   - Simulate human land use decisions and impacts
   - Assess agricultural and urban development effects
   - Model deforestation and reforestation dynamics

4. **Resource Management**
   - Understand water and energy system interactions
   - Model food production and distribution
   - Assess sustainability of resource use

## Modeling WEM with copan:LPJmL

copan:LPJmL provides a powerful framework for developing World-Earth models by:

- Integrating land surface processes with human decision-making
- Simulating vegetation dynamics and carbon cycling
- Modeling agricultural systems and food production
- Exploring feedback between climate and land use
- Testing policy interventions and management strategies

## Applications

- **Climate Projections**: Develop scenarios for future climate conditions
- **Ecosystem Services**: Assess nature's contributions to human well-being
- **Food Security**: Model agricultural production under changing conditions
- **Conservation Planning**: Identify priority areas for biodiversity protection
- **Policy Analysis**: Evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policies
