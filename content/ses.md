## Why Study Social-Ecological Systems?

**Regenerative agriculture, climate adaptation, food security, and nature's contributions to people** - these aren't separate challenges. They're **intertwined** in complex systems where human decisions and environmental processes constantly influence each other.

## The Interconnected Challenges

**üå± Regenerative Agriculture**: How do farming practices spread through communities while improving soil health and biodiversity? Traditional models can't capture the social learning and environmental feedback that drive adoption.

**üå°Ô∏è Climate Adaptation**: How do farmers actually adapt to changing weather patterns? Do they change planting dates, switch crops, or modify practices? How do these decisions affect regional food production?

**üçΩÔ∏è Food Security**: How do social networks, policy interventions, and environmental changes interact to create food security or vulnerability? What happens when climate shocks ripple through supply chains?

**üåø Nature's Contributions**: How do human decisions about land use affect the ecosystem services that support human well-being? How do changes in nature's contributions influence human behavior?

## Why Traditional Approaches Fail

**The problem:** Most research treats these as separate issues. But in reality:
- **Agricultural practices** spread through social networks while changing soil health
- **Climate adaptation** strategies interact with social learning and policy responses  
- **Food security** depends on how communities respond to environmental shocks
- **Nature's contributions** change as humans modify land use, which changes human decisions

**copan:LPJmL is the first framework that captures these intertwined dynamics on a planetary scale** by simulating how human decisions and environmental processes actually coevolve over time.

## How copan:LPJmL Helps

**Real examples from our research:**
- **Conservation tillage** spreads through social networks while improving soil carbon and crop yields
- **Climate adaptation** happens in real-time as farmers adjust planting dates without pre-computed scenarios  
- **AI-enhanced decision making** shows how complex human reasoning affects agricultural outcomes

**See our [examples](/examples/) for detailed implementations, or learn about the [technical framework](/wem/) that makes this research possible.**
